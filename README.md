## Sample data for BreatheEasyEDA


-----------------------------
**Experiment Summary**  


Participants viewed 50 negative, 50 positive, and 50 neutral images from the 
International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008). For each image, 
participants were asked if they would “Approach” or “Back away” from the scene depicted 
in the image. Physiology and event data provided with this toolbox correspond to the data 
from these presentations and judgments. Respiration, electrodermal, and electrocardiogram 
data were collected.

**Trial-type information**  


* sync summary event # 1 StartRecording
  * physiology recording begins—note: the first instance of this marks the very beginning 
  of the recording, the remainder of the time this event is listed is erroneous and 
  occurred during various rest periods for participants.
  
* sync summary event # 2 StartBaseline3min
  * corresponds to the onset of one baseline period lasting 3 minutes (first instance is 
  the real 3min baseline) at the very beginning of the experiment.

* sync summary event # 3 StartBaseline2min
  * corresponds to the onset of one baseline period lasting 2 minutes (first instance 
  is the real 2min baseline) at the very beginning of the experiment

* sync summary event # 4 EndBaseline2min
  * corresponds to the end of the baseline period (first instance is the real end of the 
  2min baseline) at the very beginning of the experiment

* sync summary event # 5 FixationOnset
  * corresponds to any “+” display 

* sync summary event # 6 StartPreClipBase
  * correspond to practice trials at the beginning of the experiment 

* sync summary event #7 neg
  * 50, 3-sec trials that correspond to 50 different negatively valenced  IAPS images 
  
* sync summary event #8 neut
  * 50, 3-sec trials that correspond to 50 different neutral valence IAPS images 
  
* sync summary event #9 pos
  * 50, 3-sec trials that correspond to 50 different positively valenced IAPS images
